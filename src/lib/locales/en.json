	"testimonial.myriam": "I had the opportunity to collaborate with Axel on improving our PHPIP database, and I can only recommend his expertise. He quickly understood the technical challenges and proposed concrete, effective solutions perfectly suited to our needs. Thanks to his intervention, our system is now much more optimized, smooth, and reliable. I particularly appreciated his responsiveness, his teaching skills, and his attention to detail throughout our collaboration. Working with Axel has been a real asset for our firm. I recommend him without hesitation to any company or firm looking for quality digital support.",
	"testimonial.amelie": "We have been working with Axel for over 2 years [I think?!], and we are very satisfied with this collaboration, whether it's for developing our website or our database. Always very responsive and clear in his explanations, he always finds a solution to our requests. It's a wonderful collaboration that we hope will continue!",
	"testimonial.amandine": "We've been collaborating with Axel for almost two years and it's a real pleasure working with him. He can do everything and always has a precise answer for us regardless of our needs. He's like the Usain Bolt of our service providers: the fastest and most efficient. In short, the best in his field!\nVery professional, serious, rigorous, reliable, and extremely friendly to boot, Axel has our complete trust and I can only recommend him!",
	"testimonial.claire": "I've been working with Axel for 1 year. Initially, I contacted him to install online software for my professional activity. Although he wasn't familiar with my field, he understood my needs very well, reformulated them perfectly, and adapted the software to my tools and usage. I use it daily and am fully satisfied. In case of updates or bugs, Axel intervenes very quickly, which minimizes interruptions.\nA true Swiss Army knife, he has a solution for each of my IT challenges. He developed an online searchable database for me, which gave him quite a challenge. By testing several approaches, he found a technical solution that allowed us to quickly have a usable interface. Again, he's very responsive when issues arise and is always available to make modifications.\nCurrently, we're working on redesigning my website. His cross-functional knowledge in this area allows him to guide me at each step and to bring in the right people when he feels he needs complementary skills.\nWhat I particularly appreciate about Axel: the special care he takes in his work, the quality of his deliverables, listening to the client and the ability to reformulate needs, transparency and clear explanations about the progress of his services, responsiveness, reasonable rates, and continuous follow-up. These qualities make him a long-term partner, whom I don't hesitate to recommend whenever I have the opportunity!",
